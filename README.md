I recently created a wireless macropad to assist in playing osrs

pcb: 2% milk 
mcu: nice! nano v2 (aliexpess clone)
switches: blue dwarf switches 
battery: 401230
extras: keebd battery switch pcb 

keymap is set to
&kp 1
&kt SPACE 

this works on pc and mobile, essentially tells your device you have the space pressed indefinitely
